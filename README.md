*DESCRIPTION*: The task was to redesign an existing website landing page to improve both usability and aesthetic appeal. The goal was to take a current homepage — one that may lack clarity, emotional connection, or visual harmony — and transform it into a more user-friendly, visually appealing interface. The final deliverables required were before-and-after visuals of the design along with a brief explanation of the design decisions made during the process.
For this task, I chose to redesign the homepage of a fictional online bookstore called Book Haven. The original design served a functional purpose but lacked emotional engagement, modern visual hierarchy, and clear guidance for user actions. My focus was to restructure the content in a way that told a stronger story, helped users navigate intuitively, and delivered a calm, inviting experience that reflects what reading truly feels like.
The redesigned homepage is divided into clearly defined sections — each built with a specific purpose and user action in mind.

1. Hero Section (Top Area):
logo and a Search Bar(to search for the books).
Two icons: cart(with number of items) and profile.
Illustration of a person reading creates an immediate connection to the purpose of the website — storytelling and reading.
Bold and clear headline: "Escape into a World of Stories" adds emotion and engagement.
Two clear Call-to-Action buttons:  Explore Books and Become a Member.
Why did I change that:  To grab attention, express the brand’s purpose quickly, and guide users toward the two main user goals.

2. Featured Categories Section:
Simple icon + label for each category: Fiction, Non-fiction, Self-help, Children and Business.
Clean grid layout for scannability.
Why did I change that:  Helps users quickly explore based on interests without getting overwhelmed.

3. Recommended Reads Section:
Book covers displayed prominently.
Title and price clearly listed.
Four-book layout keeps it minimal but visually rich.
Why did I change that:  Visual book covers increase appeal and give users a real feel of the platform’s offerings.

4. Why Book Haven? Section:
Minimalist icons + benefit-driven statements (e.g., Curated Collections).
Why did I change that:  To establish trust and differentiation, this section briefly explains the value Book Haven brings without overloading the user.

5. Footer Section:
Structured into five clear columns: Brand + Social Links, Our Shops, About Us, Help, Shop Contacts.
Brand identity reinforced with logo and tagline: Follow Book Haven.
Social media icons for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.
Quick navigation links categorized clearly under "Our Shops", "About Us" and "Help".
Shop contact numbers listed city-wise for quick reference.
Copyright note added at the bottom.
Why did I change that:
To provide easy access to key information at the bottom of every page.
Helps users find store locations, contact details, support info, or follow the brand on social platforms.
Dividing content into columns keeps the layout organized, skimmable, and mobile-friendly.

6. Aesthetic Choices:
Font style: Georgia font for headlines adds elegance and trust; inter for body text improves readability.
Color palette: Soft creams and deep blues — evoke calmness, focus, and trust.
Illustration style: Friendly, flat, and human-centered to keep the mood welcoming and not overly commercial.
